# Fake-News-Detection
A king of yellow journalism, fake news is false information and hoaxes spread through social media and other online media to achieve a political agenda. In this data science project idea, we will use Python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake. We’ll build a TfidfVectorizer and use a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify news into “Real” and “Fake”. We’ll be using a dataset of shape 7796×4 and execute everything in Jupyter Lab.
This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
